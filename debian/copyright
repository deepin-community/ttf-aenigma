Hello Brian,

We would like to redistribute your fonts as part of our Free
operating system Debian GNU/Linux (http:/debian.org), but we need
your permission to do so. Previously you told Philip that we can
"use" any of your fonts, but that does not cover the right to
"redistribute" them. We need you to properly licence your fonts, or
else we cannot make them part of our system.

Please take a moment to read this slightly longer email.

On your website, you state that we "may not Sell or Distribute my
Fonts for profit or alter the font file(s) [.ttf .fon] in any way
without asking me first."

This makes it impossible for us to put your fonts into our archive
and give easy access to hundreds of thousands of users, because we
are a Free software project and *everything* we distribute has to be
Free itself, allowing people

- to distribute your fonts further, without asking you
- to create new fonts, based on your fonts, without asking you
- to make changes to your fonts, provided those changes are noted
 and the original fonts are still attributed to you.

You can find out more about our requirements here:
 http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines


Let's assume for a minute that you'd like for us to be able to
distribute your fonts. The easiest and most sensible way to achieve
this would be to use an existing licence, such as
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0.php and make
your work publicly available under this licence; limiting the
licence to our project does not work. The advantage of such
a licence is that it's been scruitinised by lawyers and is being
used all over the place. I also release all of my software with this
licence.

Why would you want to do this? Well, the best answer is that it'll
help your work grow and reach people you wouldn't otherwise reach.
This means you'll get many more users and your name will be carried
further. It's also highly likely that you will get feedback and
patches, proposals for changes, and bug reports.

There are also other benefits. We'd also be happy to give your more
information, or answer any questions. Or you could have a look at
Eric S. Raymond's book _The Cathedral and The Bazaar_, if you'd
prefer that.

We would really like to be able to redistribute your amazing font
collection! I am hoping to be able to work with you on this.

I can also call you at +1.607.6475726 (I got that from
aenigmafonts.com whois information) if you'd prefer to talk about
this on the phone.

Thank you for your time! And I am looking forward to your reply!

Hi Brian,

thanks for your reply, and sorry that this issue keeps dragging
on...

also sprach Brian Kent <aefonts@frontiernet.net> [2008.07.04.2109 +0200]:
>   Yes, you can redistribute any of my fonts.

As I said, it's not enough to give us the permission, it has to
extend to all our users who need to be able

- to distribute your fonts further, without asking you
- to create new fonts, based on your fonts, without asking you
- to make changes to your fonts, provided those changes are noted
 and the original fonts are still attributed to you.

Is this what you intended when you wrote the above?
